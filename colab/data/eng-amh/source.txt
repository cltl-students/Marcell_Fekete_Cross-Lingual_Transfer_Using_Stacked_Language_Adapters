(Ephesians 6:12, 13) Materialistic desires, degraded entertainment and propaganda, satanic music, peer pressure at school, drug abuse, and drunkenness​—any of these can wreck our lives. Hence, the apostle goes on to counsel: “Above all things, take up the large shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the wicked one’s burning missiles.”​—Ephesians 6:16. 16 This appears to be especially necessary today in view of the bizarre music with which Satan is drenching this world. In some cases there is a direct connection to Satanism. A report from the San Diego County (U.S.A.) sheriff’s office stated: “We had a concert down here where the band had 15,000 kids chanting ‘Natas’​—that is, Satan spelled backwards.” Satanism has been described as a hole into which adolescents stumble “because they have been wandering desperate, angry and alone.” You youngsters in the Christian congregation, there is no need for you to stumble!

No wonder so many of the daughter cells go haywire.” Breast cancer begins when an irregular cell divides, loses control of its growth mechanism, and begins to proliferate. Such cells do not stop reproducing, and in time they overwhelm the surrounding healthy tissue, turning a healthy organ into a diseased one. Metastasis When cancer is contained within the breast, the malignancy can be removed. When breast cancer has spread to distant sites in the body, it is called metastatic breast cancer.

As part of the congregation, proselytes shared in the proceedings and were covered by the sacrifice. (Leviticus 16:7-10, 15, 17, 29; Deuteronomy 23:7, 8) So closely were proselytes associated with Israel under the Law that at Pentecost 33 C.E. when the first ‘key of the kingdom’ was used in behalf of the Jews, proselytes also benefited. As a result, “Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch,” became a Christian and was among the “seven certified men” appointed to care for the needs of the Jerusalem congregation.—Matthew 16:19; Acts 2:5-10; 6:3-6; 8:26-39.

(Genesis 23:2) David was grief-stricken after hearing that his son Absalom was dead. (2 Samuel 18:33) Even the perfect man Jesus wept over the death of his friend Lazarus. (John 11:35, 36) When a loved one dies, we may experience nearly overwhelming sorrow, but faith in the promises in God’s Word can help us to endure such grief.
Gilgal and Beer-sheba too must have been locations of apostate worship. To escape the foretold calamity, Israel needed to stop making religious pilgrimages to these places and start searching for Jehovah. 7:1​—To what does “the mown grass of the king” refer? It likely refers to the tax levied by the king for the upkeep of his horsemen and animals. This tax had to be paid “at the start of the coming up of the later sowing.” Afterward, the people could harvest their crops.

Professor Graham Davies writes in his book Cities of the Biblical World​—Megiddo: “The city of Megiddo . . . was easily accessible to traders and migrants from all directions; but at the same time it could, if powerful enough, control access by means of these routes and so direct the course of both trade and war. It is not surprising therefore that it was . . . a prize often fought over and when secured strongly defended.” The long history of Megiddo began in the second millennium B.C.E. when the Egyptian ruler Thutmose III defeated the Canaanite rulers there. It continued through the centuries to 1918 when British General Edmund Allenby inflicted a stinging defeat on the Turkish army.

I asked Professor Evôneo Berti Filho, who is head of the Entomology Department at the University of São Paulo in Piracicaba and a leading researcher in natural pest control. Professor Berti explained that the goal of IPM is to reduce insecticide use to the minimum necessary and to employ only those insecticides that kill specific harmful bugs. Restrained spraying is then augmented by natural forms of pest control. One such form of pest control is crop rotation. For example, from year to year, a farmer may rotate crops of corn with beans. Bugs that love corn but do not care for beans either starve or move out in search of neighborhoods with more corn. Then, the next time corn is planted, most of the bugs may be gone—at least for a while. And by the time the corn-loving bugs return en masse, another crop rotation may soon force them to pack up again. Biological control is another component of IPM.

In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.”​—Proverbs 3:5, 6. Getting to know Jehovah requires effort and dedication, yet it is within the reach of humankind through the Bible.

Isaiah said: “Jehovah of armies will certainly make for all the peoples, in this mountain, a banquet of well-oiled dishes, a banquet of wine kept on the dregs, of well-oiled dishes filled with marrow, of wine kept on the dregs, filtered.” (Isaiah 25:6) The psalmist sang: “There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.” (Psalm 72:16) Moreover, regarding earth’s inhabitants, we read: “They will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. They will not build and someone else have occupancy; they will not plant and someone else do the eating. For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full.”​—Isaiah 65:21, 22. Isaiah also foretold the end of sickness and death. God spoke through Isaiah, saying: “At that time the eyes of the blind ones will be opened, and the very ears of the deaf ones will be unstopped.
But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:

And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:
13 By showing Jesus all the kingdoms of the world, the Devil was offering him unprecedented human power. Satan hoped that what Jesus saw would appeal to him and convince him that he could become the earth’s most powerful political leader. Today, the Devil does not offer us kingdoms, but he does attempt to corrupt our hearts through our eyes, ears, and minds. 14 The Devil is in control of this world. Hence, he controls its media. It is not surprising, therefore, that the world’s viewing, listening, and reading material is saturated with immorality and violence. This world’s advertising elements try to build in us a desire for a flood of consumer goods that we do not need. By such means, the Devil constantly tempts us with materialistic attractions that can appeal to our eyes, ears, and minds. But when we refuse to view, listen to, and read Scripturally unacceptable material, we are in effect saying: “Go away, Satan!” We thus imitate Jesus in being firm and decisive in our rejection of Satan’s unclean world.

Rather, he was warning the faithful slave not to display the traits of an evil slave. Similarly, in the illustration of the ten virgins, Jesus was not indicating that half of his anointed followers would be like the five foolish virgins. Instead, he was warning his spiritual brothers about what would happen if they lost their sense of vigilance and did not prove to be prepared.* In this context, it seems reasonable to conclude that in the illustration of the talents, Jesus was not saying that a large number of his anointed brothers during the last days would be wicked and sluggish.

However, it was clear that the accusations against him were unfounded, so he was released.

Each of these languages requires different thought patterns. It appears, then, that when Jehovah God confused the speech of those rebels, he blotted out all memory of their previous common language.

No wonder the location of that tower came to be called “Confusion,” or Babel!

If all in the family cooperate to live within the family’s total income, it will spare the family many problems. Couples should agree to keep life simple and to put spiritual interests first. Children should learn contentment, not demanding things that the family budget cannot support.

The Constitution of Nepal prohibited proselytism. Anyone found propagating a so-called foreign religion was liable to seven years’ imprisonment, and a person who joined such a religion could be given a three-year jail sentence along with a heavy fine. So witnessing had to be done cautiously. The house-to-house ministry meant calling at a home, then moving to another area and making a call there. Understandably, informal witnessing played a major role in spreading the good news. Results were slow in coming. With a population of about ten million, the field seemed daunting. Seeds of truth were sown as this lone family witnessed to friends, acquaintances, employers, and fellow employees.

Safety measures have been recommended so that lobster fishermen could either have the tools to cut themselves free or prevent entanglement in the first place.

Applying Scriptural counsel results in happier family relations and freedom from many of the worries and fears that beset this world. Following Bible guidelines imparts confidence that we are pleasing the Creator. No one other than the Universal Sovereign can give a guarantee of “the life now and that which is to come” after he clears the earth of those who oppose what is right by rejecting Kingdom rule.​—1 Timothy 4:8. 25.
Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these.

Focusing on Imperfections Can Erode Loyalty 4. (a) Why is it easy to take a negative view of those in authority? (b) How did Korah prove disloyal to Jehovah’s organization? 4 When a brother is in a position of responsibility, his faults may become more apparent. How easy it is to pick at ‘a straw in our brother’s eye while ignoring a rafter in our own’! (Matthew 7:1-5) Dwelling on faults, though, can breed disloyalty. To illustrate, consider the contrast between Korah and David. Korah bore much responsibility, and he had probably been loyal for many years, but he became ambitious. He came to resent the authority of Moses and Aaron, his first cousins. Though Moses was the meekest of men, Korah evidently began to look at him with critical eyes. He likely saw faults in Moses. Those faults, however, did not justify Korah’s disloyalty to Jehovah’s organization. He was destroyed from the midst of the congregation.—Numbers 12:3; 16:11, 31-33. 5.
3 Of all humans alive in 1513 B.C.E., Moses was “by far the meekest.”

“I have positively heard Ephraim bemoaning himself,” says Jehovah. (Verse 18) He heard the Israelites as they lamented the effects of their sinful course. The phrase “bemoaning himself” can mean “a shaking or rocking motion,” says one scholar. They were like a wayward son ruefully shaking his head as he reflects on the hardships he has brought upon himself and longs for the life he had back home. (Luke 15:11-17) What were the people saying?

According to one study, “one-in-five kids who uses the Internet has been solicited for sex.” One newspaper also stated that 1 child in 33 between ages 10 and 17 were “aggressively stalked” through computer conversations. Some young people have found, to their surprise, that the “youth” with whom they shared a budding romance over the Internet was actually an adult prison inmate. Other young ones have unwittingly become involved with sexual predators. These vile people first “groom” a prospective victim, building trust through friendly on-line chat. In time, though, they seek to meet in person in order to carry out their perverted desires. Tragically, young people have been beaten, raped, and even murdered as a result.

Now the grandmother has become convinced that the important thing is, not circumcision or the lack of it, but the inculcating of God’s moral laws in children.

My father owned a big store in town that employed ten workers. Our home was next to the store, so even though Father and Mother were busy, I never felt lonely. I am the oldest of three girls, and from an early age, I was trained to take over the family business. I married young. My husband quit his job at the bank and came to help in the family business. We had three children in quick succession. My mother looked after the children as she performed the household chores, while I worked from morning till night at the store. Even so, we still had some free time to spend together as a family. Then the shopping district was hit by an economic decline, and our business started to suffer.

5 The 70th “week” was to be seven years of special favor extended to the Jews. Starting in 29 C.E., it included Jesus’ baptism and ministry, his sacrificial death “at the half of the week” in 33 C.E., and another ‘half week’ until 36 C.E. During this “week,” the opportunity to become Jesus’ anointed disciples was extended exclusively to God-fearing Jews and Jewish proselytes. Then in 70 C.E., a date not known in advance, the Roman legions under Titus exterminated the apostate Jewish system.​—Daniel 9:26, 27. 6.

I’m too tired to cook.” But her devoted husband may seize the moment to praise her cooking and swear that he prefers it to any other. Or he may feel, ‘She’s trying to manipulate me!’ Meanwhile, a wife may resentfully say to herself, ‘Why should I have to ask?’
