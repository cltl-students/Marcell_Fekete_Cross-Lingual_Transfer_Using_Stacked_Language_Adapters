It is true that he who says “the silver is mine, and the gold is mine” does not depend on our financial assistance in order to accomplish his work. Yet, Jehovah has dignified his servants with the privilege of having a share in sanctifying his name by their contributing to the preaching of lifesaving truths “to all the nations.” (Matthew 24:14; 28:19, 20) Are you not moved to do all you can to support this never-to-be-repeated work? [Footnote] For a list of the languages, see page 2 of this magazine. [Box on page 18] “THEY MAKE US THINK SERIOUSLY” A 14-year-old girl wrote to the Cameroon branch of Jehovah’s Witnesses: “After buying my school supplies for the year, I was able to sell two of last year’s textbooks for 2,500 francs [$5, U.S.].

Cartoon strips have mentioned the Witnesses. Their zealous activity is so well-known that cartoonists around the world have included references to Jehovah’s Witnesses. These may appear to be satirical, but they are usually based on a positive fundamental fact​—that the Witnesses are known for their persistent house-to-house preaching.​—Acts 20:20. One recent cartoon showed a man climbing a mountain to consult a “guru.” He said: “Speak to me of wondrous things to come!” How did the “guru” answer? “Let’s see . . . There will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon to blood.” The inquirer asked: “What’s the good news?” To which the “guru” responded: “God will wipe away every tear . . . and there shall be no more death nor sorrow nor pain!”

(Numbers 14:2) What a gross lack of appreciation! Not surprisingly, Jehovah said to Moses: “How long will this people treat me without respect, and how long will they not put faith in me?” (Numbers 14:11) Those ungrateful complainers were condemned to wander in the wilderness for 40 years until that generation passed away. The apostle Paul reminds us of this example. He warns fellow Christians never to be like those Israelites who became murmurers, only to perish in the wilderness. (1 Corinthians 10:10, 11) Clearly, unjustified murmuring and a spirit of complaint can undermine our faith and lead to Jehovah’s displeasure. Yet, Jehovah is patient with his servants who may occasionally complain because of discouraging circumstances. When Elijah fled to Mount Horeb because of persecution by wicked Queen Jezebel, he was convinced that his work as a prophet had come to an end. He mistakenly assumed that he was the only worshiper of Jehovah remaining in the land. To strengthen Elijah’s faith, God first gave him a demonstration of His divine power. The prophet was then told that there were still 7,000 faithful servants of Jehovah in Israel and that there was much work for him to do. Consequently, Elijah forgot his complaints and went forward with renewed vigor. (1 Kings 19:4, 10-12, 15-18) As Christian elders exercise discernment, they can likewise speak consolingly to faithful ones, helping them to see their role in the outworking of God’s purpose.​—1 Thessalonians 5:14. Overcoming a Spirit of Complaint How can a spirit of complaint be overcome? Well, those who are given proof about the harm tobacco does to the body have a powerful incentive to stop smoking. Similarly, understanding why a spirit of complaint is so detrimental can motivate us to break any habit of complaining. What benefits result to those who overcome a complaining spirit?

After adequately satisfying their basic needs, they embark on the pursuit of riches. Yet, beyond food, clothing, and shelter, how much does a person really need? No wonder the Bible writer quoted at the beginning of this article also wrote: “Having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.” (1 Timothy 6:8) Cultivating contentment prevents us from developing the love of money and all the problems that come along with it. The love of money is indeed the root of many evil things. Money will become your master if you let it. When managed properly, however, money can provide you with the freedom to pursue the more important things in life, such as a close bond with family, friends, and God.

Practically all of them must die and be replaced. Each type of cell has a different life span; some are replaced every few weeks, and others every few years. Our body’s system of programmed cell death has to be highly controlled to maintain the delicate balance between cell death and cell formation. What can go wrong? Some studies indicate that when cells fail to die as they should, rheumatoid arthritis or cancer may result.

Second, when Isaac realized that he had given the blessing to Jacob, he did not seek to change what he had done. Perhaps he recalled what Jehovah had told Rebekah before the twins were born: “The older will serve the younger.” (Genesis 25:23) It is noteworthy too that when Jacob was about to depart for Haran, Isaac expanded the blessing that he had given earlier.​—Genesis 28:1-4.

(a) What is a codex, and why was it easier to use than a scroll? (b) When did most Christians start using books? 12 What did Christians in the first century use to teach the Bible? First, they used scrolls. But scrolls were not easy to use or carry. Every time Christians wanted to find a scripture, they had to unroll a scroll and later roll it up again. Scrolls usually had writing only on one side.

Kingdom Fruitage Produced Despite the challenges in this oldest witnessing territory, those “hearing the word and getting the sense of it” do bring forth Kingdom fruitage in this field. (Matthew 13:23) “There are people who are thirsty for the truth, lovers of righteousness who are literally searching for it,” observed an experienced full-time minister. “They are not influenced by opinions or pressures from others. When the opportunity to learn the truth strikes, they quickly seize it.”

Moreover, at Job 19:25-27 this man of faith and integrity spoke of having a “redeemer” and of later ‘beholding God.’ Yes, Job believed in a resurrection. He believed that God could and would bring him back to life, even as Abraham was previously convinced of God’s ability to ‘raise up the dead.’​—Hebrews 11:10, 16, 19, 35. Right down into our modern times, the Jews have believed in a future resurrection to life on the earth.

Since this was soon after John the Baptizer had been beheaded by Herod Antipas and just before the Passover, which marked the start of the last year of Jesus’ earthly ministry, Jesus surely had much to meditate on in his personal prayer to the Father. Along with the four watches, a 12-hour count of the nighttime was also in use. In order to escort Paul safely to Caesarea, military commander Claudius Lysias told his officers to get ready a band of 470 soldiers “at the third hour of the night.” (Acts 23:23, 24) Thus Paul was taken safely under cover of night away from Jerusalem. Know the Time of Day Reading and meditating on accounts of what happened among God’s ancient people is a source of pleasure and spiritual strength. If you can include the time factor in your consideration, it will certainly increase the joy of your Bible study. Why so?
12 Many lands have laws or governmental agencies to protect neglected and abused children. The children of Jehovah’s Witnesses are not being neglected or abused when parents decide against allowing their beloved son or daughter to be given blood, requesting at the same time the use of alternative therapies that modern medicine can provide. Even from a medical standpoint, this is not neglect or abuse, considering the admitted dangers of transfusion therapy.

Most of those Georgians who live in the north Iranian provinces of Gilan, Mazandaran, Isfahan, Tehran Province and the rest of Iran no longer speak the language but keep a Georgian conscience. The Circassians in Iran, a very large minority in the past and speakers of the Circassian language, have been strongly assimilated and absorbed within the population in the past few centuries. However, significant pockets do exist spread over the country, and they are the second-largest Caucasus-derived group in the nation after the Georgians.[18][19]

I will show a waiting attitude for the God of my salvation.” (Micah 7:7; Lamentations 3:21) We too can show a waiting attitude. How? In many ways. For one thing, we may feel that a brother in authority has acted in error and that an immediate correction is needed. A waiting attitude will allow us to consider, ‘Was he really in error, or am I mistaken? If he was in error, could it be that Jehovah is allowing events to unfold because he feels that the individual will improve and that drastic corrective measures will be unnecessary?’ 6. How will a waiting attitude help someone struggling with a personal problem? 6 A waiting attitude may be needed if we are troubled by a personal problem or are struggling with a weakness. Suppose we ask for Jehovah’s help, but the problem persists.

Yohimbe is an herbal supplement that is used to treat erectile dysfunction and promote weight loss. The main way that yohimbe works in the body is through blocking alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. Raw Yohimbine powder blocks alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors, increasing adrenaline and dopamine and decreasing serotonin levels. Blocking these receptors also increases blood pressure, releases insulin, and decreases blood sugar levels.Raw Yohimbine powder blocks serotonin-1B, -1D,-2A, and -2B (5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2B) receptors, and dopamine-2 and dopamine-3 (D2 and D3) receptors.

For one thing, ants get a lot done.

The sin now is getting caught, not the violation.” The apostle Paul wrote about people with such attitudes: “They are in darkness mentally, and alienated from the life that belongs to God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the insensibility of their hearts. Having come to be past all moral sense, they gave themselves over to loose conduct to work uncleanness of every sort with greediness.” (Ephesians 4:18, 19) But trouble looms for them. Isaiah declared: “Woe to those who are saying that good is bad and bad is good, those who are putting darkness for light and light for darkness.” (Isaiah 5:20) Not only do these ones reap what they sow now but they will soon experience their greatest “woe”​—adverse judgment from Jehovah.​—Galatians 6:7. “When the wicked ones sprout as the vegetation and all the practicers of what is hurtful blossom forth, it is that they may be annihilated forever,” says Psalm 92:7.

Sidney was baptized the year before, so he and Irene served together as pioneers​—full-time evangelizers—​along the north coast of Wales, from Bangor to Caernarvon, including the island of Anglesey. At that time, I was in the Runcorn Congregation, some 13 miles [20 km] southeast of Liverpool, serving as what we today call the presiding overseer. Irene approached me at a circuit assembly to ask if she could have some territory where she could preach, as she was going to stay with Vera, her married sister who lived in Runcorn. Irene and I got along well together during the two weeks she was with us, and I later visited her in Bangor on a number of occasions. How happy I was when one weekend Irene accepted my proposal of marriage! Returning home on Sunday, I immediately began to make plans for our wedding, but on Tuesday a telegram awaited me. “I’m sorry this telegram is going to hurt,” it read. “I am canceling our wedding. Letter to follow.” I was shocked. What could have gone wrong?

A study of God’s Word has always been a prerequisite for those who would gain the favor and approval of the Most High God, Jehovah. Kings, priests, parents, men, women, and children​—rich and poor alike—​were instructed to take time from the everyday affairs of life to give serious and prayerful consideration to the recorded Word of God.​—Deuteronomy 6:6, 7; 17:18-20; 31:9-12; Nehemiah 8:8; Psalm 1:1, 2; 119:7-11, 72, 98-100, 104, 142; Proverbs 3:13-18. For example, Joshua was directed: “Be sure that the book of the Law is always read in your worship.
But why the delay? Frans pointed to three cartons he had brought along. He had gone to the capital to collect a supply of Bible literature for the refugee Witnesses. The waiting brothers were delighted. That same day, Frans, the rescued Witnesses, and the three cartons crossed the border safely. Later Frans made another trip to help more Witnesses. Eventually, 37 Witnesses crossed the border and settled in refugee camps. Frans was placed in a former leper colony in French Guiana, where the refugees are not supposed to do anything more than sway in their hammocks and ward off mosquitoes.

The figures are influenced by the country's testing policy. If two countries are alike in every respect, including having the same spread of infection, the country that only tests people admitted to hospitals will have a higher figure for "% (Percentage of positive tests)" than a country that tests all citizens whether or not they are showing symptoms. If two countries are alike in every respect, including which people they test, the one that tests more people will have a higher "Positive / million people."[146] 
Friedrich Hayek, Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman.

Bittrolff had been linked to the 1990s murders by DNA. The police made no comment, as the LISK homicide investigation is active.[1][24] In June 2019, a proposal was made to use genetic genealogy to identify the unidentified victims and possibly the killer.[25]

What is the solution for a husband? Some husbands confuse what the Bible says about wifely subjection with what it says about the obedience of a child to his parent. (Colossians 3:20; 1 Peter 3:1) However, the Bible says that a husband is to “stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh”; it does not say the same about a parent and a child. (Matthew 19:5) Jehovah describes a wife as a complement, or counterpart, of her husband. (Genesis 2:18) He never refers to a child as being a complement, or counterpart, of a parent.

(Matthew 24:45; 2 Kings 10:15) At that time, on the basis of Revelation 22:17, these sheeplike ones were specifically encouraged to share in taking the Kingdom message to others. Their appreciation for the Messianic Kingdom would move them not merely to extend humanitarian kindness to the Lord’s anointed ones but to dedicate their lives to Jehovah through Christ and to become closely associated with his anointed ones, sharing zealously in the work that they are doing.

(Ephesians 6:12; Revelation 12:7-12) Mankind had already been plunged into its first world war. Early in August 1914, when war seemed certain, Sir Edward Grey, the British secretary of state for foreign affairs, stood at his office window in London and said: “The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.” 3. What success have world leaders had in trying to brighten the outlook for mankind? 3 In an effort to make those lights come back on, the League of Nations was put into operation in 1920.

Be discerning Music can be a window into your child’s world and heart. Gently draw out his feelings. Ask: “What do you like about this music? Does it express any concerns you may have?” Then listen carefully to the reply. Says Proverbs 20:5: “A person’s thoughts are like water in a deep well, but someone with insight can draw them out.”​—TEV.

Those visits were truly encouraging! During my first year in Ipuã, 38 different brothers and sisters made the long journey to see me. In 1992, six years after the death of João, I received another invitation from Jehovah’s organization, this time to move to Franca, São Paulo State, where I still serve as a full-time minister. The territory here is very productive. In 1994, I started a Bible study with the mayor.
He had been adopted by the king’s family. He “was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,” which probably included the arts, astronomy, mathematics, and other sciences. (Acts 7:22) It would have been very easy for him to have the money, power, and privileges that a common Egyptian could never have. 2 Despite all the opportunities Moses had, he made a decision when he was 40 years old that must have been impossible for Pharaoh and his family to understand. He chose to give up his future in Egypt. Did he want the life of a common Egyptian? No, not even that! He chose to suffer with slaves. Why? Moses had faith. (Read Hebrews 11:24-26.) Because of his faith, it was as if Moses could see Jehovah. He had faith in “the One who is invisible” and in the fulfillment of God’s promises.​—Hebrews 11:27. 3. What three questions will be answered in this article? 3 Like Moses, we need to have eyes of faith to see more than what the world has to offer and to see Jehovah. We must be “the sort who have faith.” (Hebrews 10:38, 39) To help us strengthen our faith, let us examine what is written about Moses at Hebrews 11:24-26. As we do so, try to answer these questions: How did faith help Moses to reject fleshly desires? When he faced opposition, how did faith help him to value his privilege of serving Jehovah? And why did Moses look “intently toward the payment of the reward”? HE REJECTED FLESHLY DESIRES 4. What did Moses understand about the “enjoyment of sin”? 4 With eyes of faith, Moses was able to understand that the “enjoyment of sin” was only temporary. Others might have seen things differently. Why? They had seen Egypt, a place where idolatry and spiritism were common, become a world power, while Jehovah’s people suffered as slaves. But Moses knew that God could change the situation. Although those who focused on satisfying their own desires seemed to be successful, Moses had faith that the wicked would be destroyed. As a result, he was not tempted by “the temporary enjoyment of sin.” 5. What will help us to resist “the temporary enjoyment of sin”? 5 How can you resist “the temporary enjoyment of sin”? Never forget that the pleasure that comes from sinning lasts for only a short time. Faith will help you to see that “the world is passing away and so is its desire.” (1 John 2:15-17) Meditate on the future of unrepentant sinners.

Dustin explained why he preferred to go to the Kingdom Hall. His father acquiesced and said that he would allow Dustin to go there. One evening after attending a meeting at the Kingdom Hall, Dustin’s mother could not find him. Without telling her, he had approached the Theocratic Ministry School overseer and had asked about enrolling in the school. His mother agreed. Excitedly he looked forward to his first talk assignment. At the same time, however, he began to have severe pain in his hip, and he was thus taken to various doctors for examination. Finally, the big night for Dustin’s talk at the Kingdom Hall arrived. By then, he was using crutches. Although it was obvious that he was in pain, he walked without them to the platform.
It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me. 
Power engineering, also called power systems engineering, is a subfield of electrical engineering that deals with the generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of electric power, and the electrical apparatus connected to such systems. Although much of the field is concerned with the problems of three-phase AC power – the standard for large-scale power transmission and distribution across the modern world – a significant fraction of the field is concerned with the conversion between AC and DC power and the development of specialized power systems such as those used in aircraft or for electric railway networks. Power engineering draws the majority of its theoretical base from electrical engineering.
